tp1: []
tp2: [F 10]
tp1 now as tp2+tp3: [F 10 R 90]
tp1 now as tp2 * 3: [F 10 F 10 F 10]
tp4 is a copy of tp1: [F 10 F 10 F 10]
tp5: [F 10]
tp2 and tp5 are == to each other: true
tp2 and tp3 are != to each other: true
index 0 of tp2 is F
tp2 after 2 calls to setIndex: [R 90]
tp2 and tp3 are == to each other: true

=== Additional Test Cases ===
tp6 (copy of tp2): [R 90]
tp6 after changing tp2: [R 90]
tp7 after chaining assignment: [R 90]
tp8 before += chain: [F 30]
tp8 after += chain: [F 30 R 90 R 90]
tp9 = (tp2 + tp3) * 2: [R 90 R 90 R 90 R 90]
tp2 * 0: []
tp2 * -1: []
tp2 * 1: [R 90]
empty1 + empty2: []
empty1 == empty2: true
tp2.getIndex(-1): ''
tp2.getIndex(999): ''
Initial tp10: [F 5]
After *=2: [F 5 F 5]
After +=tp2: [F 5 F 5 R 90]
After *=3: [F 5 F 5 R 90 F 5 F 5 R 90 F 5 F 5 R 90]
Done.
